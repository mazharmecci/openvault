      <h2>🌟 Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        OpenVault exists to remove the confusion, stress, and guesswork from final-year projects and digital implementation in education.
        We bring together a curated vault of software projects, dashboards, and workflows so that institutions can focus on mentoring, not firefighting.

      <p>
        From solo students to large campuses, our goal is simple: make high-quality, deployment-ready project work accessible, affordable, and emotionally rewarding.
