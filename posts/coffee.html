          For most people, coffee is a button on a machine and a mug on the table — but the reality is far more poetic. Each cup has already travelled across continents, altitudes, and hands before it ever reaches your desk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind that single sip lies an entire ecosystem of farmers, forests, science, craft, and culture. This is the quiet, fascinating journey from coffee plantation to your favourite brew.

          Coffee is not just a drink. It is a chain of people and places that starts in misty estates and ends in your morning ritual.
        </div>

        <h2>🌏 The Bean Belt: Where Coffee Is Born</h2>
        <p>
          Coffee thrives in a narrow band around the equator known as the <strong>“coffee belt” or “bean belt.”</strong> These regions share warm days, cool nights, and just the right amount of rainfall.[web:6]
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideal conditions include altitudes between roughly 800 and 2000 metres, well-drained soils (often volcanic), and stable tropical climates — all of which slow the cherry’s growth and intensify flavour.[web:6]
        </p>

        <h3>Iconic Coffee Regions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>🇪🇹 <strong>Ethiopia</strong> – Widely regarded as coffee’s birthplace; famous for floral, fruity, tea-like profiles.</li>
          <li>🇨🇴 <strong>Colombia</strong> – Andes-grown coffees with balanced acidity and notes of chocolate and nuts.</li>
          <li>🇧🇷 <strong>Brazil</strong> – The world’s largest producer, known for smooth, easy-drinking, chocolatey cups.</li>
          <li>🇮🇳 <strong>Coorg & Chikmagalur (India)</strong> – Shade-grown on forested slopes, often showing cocoa, spice, and mellow sweetness.</li>
          <li>🇻🇳 <strong>Vietnam</strong> – A global leader in robust, high-caffeine Robusta beans.[web:6][web:8]</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🌱 From Cherry to Green Bean</h2>
        <p>
          Coffee begins as a bright red cherry on a shrub-like tree, often grown under taller shade trees that protect the soil, conserve moisture, and support biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside each cherry are usually <strong>two seeds</strong> — the beans — wrapped in layers of skin, pulp, and parchment that must be carefully removed before roasting can begin.
        </p>

        <h3>Processing: Washed, Natural, Honey</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>💧 <strong>Washed (wet) process</strong> – The outer fruit is removed, beans are fermented in water, washed clean, and then dried. This method commonly produces clean, bright, and consistent flavour profiles.[web:11][web:15]</li>
          <li>☀️ <strong>Natural (dry) process</strong> – Whole cherries are laid out to dry in the sun, allowing the fruit to “raisin” on the bean. This often creates sweeter, fruitier, and more complex cups, especially in regions like Brazil and Ethiopia.[web:11][web:15]</li>
          <li>🍯 <strong>Honey process</strong> – Part of the sticky mucilage is left on the bean while it dries. The result sits between washed and natural: more sweetness and body than washed, without the full wild fruitiness of naturals.[web:11][web:14]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          One of the most fascinating facts about coffee is that the same variety from the same farm can taste completely different when processed using these three techniques — proof that post-harvest decisions shape the cup as much as geography.
        </p>

        <h2>🧬 Arabica vs Robusta: Two Personalities</h2>
        <p>
          Although there are many coffee species, two dominate: <strong>Arabica</strong> and <strong>Robusta.</strong> Together, they define most of what we taste in everyday coffee.[web:8]
        </p>
        <p>
          Arabica plants are more delicate and prefer higher elevations, while Robusta is hardier, tolerating lower altitudes, warmer climates, and pests more effectively.[web:8]
        </p>

        <h3>How They Differ in the Cup</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>🌿 <strong>Arabica</strong> – Typically contains more natural sugars and lipids, delivering sweeter, smoother, and more nuanced flavours, with notes ranging from fruit and flowers to chocolate.[web:8]</li>
          <li>⚡ <strong>Robusta</strong> – Usually higher in caffeine (often above 2.5%), more bitter and earthy, with a heavier body that helps produce thick crema in espresso.[web:8]</li>
          <li>🧪 <strong>Experience</strong> – Many specialty coffees focus on Arabica for its complexity, while blends often add Robusta for structure, strength, and that extra “kick.”[web:8]</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🔥 Roasting: Where Aroma Wakes Up</h2>
        <p>
          Green coffee beans have little aroma and a grassy character. Roasting changes everything: sugars caramelize, and complex reactions build the flavours and smells people associate with coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roasters continually experiment with charge temperature, roast curve, and development time to highlight origin flavours or create darker, bolder profiles suited to milk-based drinks.
        </p>

        <h3>Roast Levels in Simple Language</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>🌅 <strong>Light roast</strong> – Emphasises acidity and origin character; expect citrus, floral, and berry-like notes in the right coffees.</li>
          <li>🌤️ <strong>Medium roast</strong> – Balances body, sweetness, and brightness; a versatile choice for most brewing methods.</li>
          <li>🌙 <strong>Dark roast</strong> – Bolder, smokier, and more bitter; pairs well with milk and sugar, and often used for espresso in traditional setups.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🌀 Brewing & Filtering: Same Bean, Many Stories</h2>
        <p>
          Brewing is where you, the drinker, become part of the coffee’s journey. Broadly, methods fall into <strong>immersion</strong>, <strong>percolation</strong>, and <strong>espresso-style pressure brewing.</strong>[web:16][web:19]
        </p>
        <p>
          In immersion methods, coffee grounds and water sit together for a set time, while in percolation, water flows continuously through a bed of coffee, extracting flavours as it passes.[web:16][web:19]
        </p>

        <h3>Popular Brew Methods</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>🫙 <strong>French press (immersion)</strong> – Coarse grounds steep in hot water, creating a rich, full-bodied brew with pronounced mouthfeel.[web:16][web:19]</li>
          <li>🧵 <strong>Pour-over (percolation)</strong> – Hot water passes through a paper filter and coffee bed, leading to clean, bright cups where individual flavour notes are easy to taste.[web:16][web:19]</li>
          <li>⚙️ <strong>Espresso</strong> – High-pressure water extraction over 25–30 seconds, producing concentrated, syrupy shots topped with crema.[web:19]</li>
          <li>❄️ <strong>Cold brew (long immersion)</strong> – Coffee steeps in cold water for many hours, resulting in a smooth, chocolaty cup with lower perceived acidity.[web:16][web:19]</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🌍 Culture in a Cup</h2>
        <p>
          From South Indian filter kaapi served in steel tumblers to Italian espresso at the bar, from Turkish cezve rituals to minimalist third-wave cafés, coffee is as much about people and place as it is about flavour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next time you sip your morning brew, you are tasting the work of farmers, pickers, processors, exporters, roasters, baristas, and technologists — all connected in a single cup that quietly powers your day.
