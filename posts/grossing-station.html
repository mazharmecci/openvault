  <p class="lede">
    Grossing is where every histopathology case truly begins. A well-designed grossing station, paired with the right boards and tools, reduces errors, keeps your team safer and sets the tone for everything that follows — from processing to reporting. 🙂
  </p>

  <h2>Why grossing deserves priority in your capex plan</h2>
  <p>
    Many labs invest heavily in processors and stainers but underestimate the impact of the grossing area. Yet mislabeling, poor specimen orientation or exposure to formalin vapours often start here — and can quietly erode diagnostic quality and staff morale.
  </p>
  <p>
    Modern grossing systems from ISTOS Medical focus on three pillars:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Operator safety</strong> – effective ventilation, splash control and formalin management.</li>
    <li><strong>Workflow efficiency</strong> – generous work surface, instrument organization and lighting.</li>
    <li><strong>Specimen integrity</strong> – stable platforms for precise dissection and clear visual documentation. ✅</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ISTOS Grossing Stations: Key design features</h2>
  <p>
    ISTOS grossing stations are engineered around stainless steel construction and thoughtful ergonomics so your team can gross comfortably through long theatre lists without compromising quality. [file:32]
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete stainless steel working surface in high-grade 316 for corrosion resistance and hygiene. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Integrated sink with wrist-operated taps for hands-free washing and decontamination. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Adequate LED task lighting sized for the work area, with options for adjustable shelves and tap guns. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Auto dispensing for formalin or saline to standardise fixation volumes and cut manual handling. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Provision for macro photography setups, cutting boards, eyewash and formaldehyde neutralisation. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Connectivity to central exhaust systems to pull vapours away from the operator’s breathing zone. [file:32]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Labs can opt for customised configurations based on bench length, storage needs and theatre load, ensuring the grossing space grows with the institution. [file:32]
  </p>

      Customisable lengths, integrated sinks and exhaust connections help ISTOS grossing benches fit both compact and large-format labs.

  <h2>Grossing boards: fast, accurate and easy to clean</h2>
  <p>
    The right grossing board turns a flat metal surface into a controlled dissection platform. ISTOS offers plastic trimming boards that balance grip, drainage and measurement support. [file:32]
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Safe, fast and accurate dissection surface with a rugged, lab-grade plastic build. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Separate tool board to keep knives, scissors and rulers organised and within easy reach. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Stainless steel trimming inserts for durability where blades contact the surface most. [file:32]</li>
    <li>One or more tampers to help flatten tissue consistently before cassette loading. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Integrated ruler for rapid dimensional measurements without reaching for a separate scale. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Removable black trimming plate to improve visual contrast for pale tissues. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Circumferential drain channel with drainage holes to keep the work zone drier and safer. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Smooth, easy-to-clean surfaces to support infection control and turnaround between cases. [file:32]</li>
  </ul>

      Trimming boards with integrated rulers and drainage channels help teams work faster while preserving specimen quality.

  <h2>Grossing toolkits: everything in the right place 🧰</h2>
  <p>
    Standardised toolkits reduce variation between technicians and make it easier to train new staff. ISTOS tool sets cover the essentials needed for routine histopathology grossing. [file:32]
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sharp dissecting knives for clean margin cuts and complex resections. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Scalpels and cartridge knives for routine trimming and fine work. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Sturdy scissors for soft tissue and fat dissection. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Rulers for consistent measurement recording in reports. [file:32]</li>
    <li>Configurable layouts on the tool board to match local SOPs and user preferences. [file:32]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When combined with a well-designed bench and board, these tools help teams maintain reproducible grossing quality day after day, even as volumes increase. 🚀
  </p>

  <h2>When should a lab upgrade grossing infrastructure?</h2>
  <p>
    Consider planning an upgrade if your team reports frequent headaches from fumes, struggles with cramped work areas, or sees inconsistent grossing documentation across shifts. [file:32]
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your lab is moving from low to medium/high biopsy volumes.</li>
    <li>You are preparing for accreditation audits that emphasise biosafety and traceability.</li>
    <li>You want to reduce technician exposure to formalin and other volatile agents.</li>
    <li>You are setting up a new histopathology lab and want a future-proof grossing layout.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ISTOS Medical can help map your specimen flow, suggest bench configurations and supply grossing stations, boards and tools as a cohesive package rather than isolated components. [file:32]

  <div class="grid-3" style="margin-top:12px;">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Can ISTOS customise grossing benches for my lab layout?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Benches can be configured for different lengths, sink positions, exhaust connections and storage layouts so the grossing area fits your room and workflow instead of the other way around. [file:32]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Do I need specialised exhaust if I already use PPE?</h3>
      <p>PPE is essential but not sufficient. Localised exhaust and formalin management at the bench significantly reduce long-term exposure and improve comfort for staff working full shifts at grossing. [file:32]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Can I upgrade only boards and tools first?</h3>
      <p>Many labs start with new trimming boards and tool sets to stabilise technique while planning a larger bench upgrade. ISTOS can phase deployments to match your budgets and renovation timelines. [file:32]</p>
